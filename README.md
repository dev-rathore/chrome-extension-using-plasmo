## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm i` or `pnp i`

2. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

See how to load the extension: https://docs.plasmo.com/framework/workflows/dev#loading-the-extension

For further guidance, [visit our Documentation](https://docs.plasmo.com/).

## Making production build

Run the following:

```bash
pnpm build
# or
npm run build
```

This should create a production bundle for your extension, ready to be zipped and published to the stores.
